# Movie Trailer Website

This is a collection of my favorite movies that I like to watch anytime presented through a static web page.
The movies are stored as Python dict inside _entertainment_center.py_ file.
And _entertainment_center.py_ is called from _media.py_. 

## Run

* Clone the project to your local directory

* Open the command prompt / terminal, make sure terminal path is the project location
* To run the python file _media.py_, enter `python media.py` in your terminal
* This will generate the static HTML file with the favorite movies listed.

## Dependencies
The projects is depended on the _freshtomatoes.py_. To include this dependency - 
* Clone [ud036_StarterCode](https://github.com/nimitbhargava/ud036_StarterCode) into the Movie Trailer Website directory.
